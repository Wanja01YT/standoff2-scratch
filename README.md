# Standoff 2: Scratch Edition
<i>This project requires a lot of resources, therefore it is recommended to close other tabs and applications for best performance.</i>

A complete recreation of [Standoff 2](https://install.standoff2.com/) inside of the [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) game engine, including the training mode, full main menu and even some skins! ðŸ‘€

### Controls:

- 1 / 2 / 3 - Pistol / Rifle / Knife
- B - Buy Weapon
- A / D - Move Left / Right
- And touchscreen or mouse for the rest!

Thanks to Axlebolt for creating the original game as a base for this project.
